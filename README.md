# EE3-Car-Project
Made a path following car for the final project of EE3. Partner was Dennis Zang. First code, follow_path, allows car to follow a black line, stopping at a double solid black line. The car utilizes four phototransistors to detect if the car is over white or black and depending on those readings makes the correct adjustment while traversing the path. 
Second code, slow_down, demonstrates the relationship between the PWM inputted into wheel circuit and the wheel speed.
